Example program
===============

Use this simple program to test `mdb`.

To build `simple-mpi.exe` use the `Makefile`. You will need a Fortran compiler and either open MPI
or Intel MPI.

```shell
$ make
```

For information on how to run the binary through `mdb` please see the documentation. There is also
an `mdb` debug script which runs a sample debug session.
