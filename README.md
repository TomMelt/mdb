An MPI debugger built on [`gdb`](https://www.sourceware.org/gdb/).

# Documentation

For help with installation, a quick-start tutorial (with example debug session) and an API reference please check out `mdb`'s
[documentation](https://mdb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

# Purpose

`mdb` is a debugger aimed at parallel programs using the MPI programming paradigm. `mdb` acts as a wrapper around `gdb` and, as
such, it supports the following languages:

* C
* C++
* Fortran

Technically `gdb` supports other languages as well, but this is the intersection of languages that MPI is implemented in.

# Usage

Please see the [quick start guide](https://mdb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html#quick-start) in the documentation for a
walk-through of a simple debug session. The guide covers basic debug commands and information on how to launch the debugger.

# Installation

These instructions are for normal use of `mdb`. Please see [below](#Developers) for a developer install.

1. Clone the repository.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/TomMelt/mdb.git
    ```

2. (optional - but recommended) Create a `conda` environment or `venv`.

    ```bash
    conda create -n mdb python
    conda activate mdb
    ```

3. Install `mdb`.

    ```bash
    cd mdb/
    pip install .
    ```

More information can be found in the [installation
guide](https://mdb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#installing-mdb).

**Please Note** `mdb` doesn't currently support Windows (see
[here](https://mdb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#windows-support) for more info).

## Dependencies

### Non-Python Dependencies

* `gdb`
* `gdbserver`
* `youplot`/`uplot` (optional - see [here](https://github.com/red-data-tools/YouPlot) for installation instructions)

`mdb` does not package `gdb` or `gdbserver`. You will need these installed on your system in order to run `mdb`. Please visit
[GNU's website](https://sourceware.org/gdb/) for information on how to install `gdb` and `gdbserver` on your system.

`youplot` is a command line tool for fancy Unicode plots in the terminal. It is completely optional and `mdb` can default to
`matplotlib` for plotting instead.

### Python Dependencies

The main python dependencies are (see [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt)):

* `click`
* `matplotlib`
* `numpy`
* `pexpect`
* `rich`

These will all be installed as part of the default `pip` installation. See [installing
mdb](https://mdb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#installing-mdb) in the documentation for more information.

# Supported MPI implementations

Currently I am building and testing for open MPI only. In principle it really won't take much work to expand to other
implementations but I just haven't done it yet.

- [x] open MPI mpirun
- [x] intel MPI mpirun
- [ ] slurm srun?
- [x] mpiexec ?
- [ ] others...

# TODO

- [ ] upload tests
- [ ] rewrite launcher to add more functionality (e.g., auto-restart if MPI job fails)
- [ ] intercept `stdin` to run commands on another process (or processes) inside of an interactive session
- [ ] track MPI communication dependencies (holistic metric)
- [ ] print aggregated backtrace (holistic metric)
- [ ] record asciinema demo? / youtube video?

# Contributing

If you would like to be involved in the development, feel free to submit a PR. A word of caution though... the code is currently
in a highly volatile state and a plan major changes to the interface and layout. I will update this section when I reach a more
stable part of the development. Either way changes are welcome at anytime.

Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details on how best to contribute.

# Developers

For development it is best to install `mdb` with some additional dependencies. These can be installed following the [installing
mdb for developers](https://mdb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#for-developers) guide.

# Acknowledgements

This project was inspired by @mystery-e204's [mpidb](https://github.com/mystery-e204/mpidb) tool and @Azrael3000's
[tmpi](https://github.com/Azrael3000/tmpi) tmux interface.

# Similar Projects

I have recently come across @robertu94's [mpigdb](https://github.com/robertu94/mpigdb). It seems to offer similar functionality
and it has a closer integration with gdb using gdb's inbuilt `inferior`s to handle multiple processes at the same time (see
[gdb manual sec. 4.9](https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb.html/Inferiors-Connections-and-Programs.html#Inferiors-Connections-and-Programs)
for more info). The main difference from my perspective is that I can plot variables across MPI processes using `mdb` and AFAIK
`mpigdb` cannot. If you like `mdb` you may want to check out `mpigdb` as well.
